## Overview of the statistical analysis
In this project, we start to use SQLAlchemy as primary technologies for the module. And create the session link to the database that allow us to query for data. Overall, we retrieve and analyze the precipitation data relate on date, temperature(min, max, avg) from measurement and station.

## Results:
Review the picture below on June and December
- The average temperature between June and Decemember, June temperature is 74.94 degrees and December temperature is 71.04 degree.
The temperature of June are higher than Decemember in each day.
- The minimum tempterature of Decemember is drop down to 56 dergees. It means the water are cold right now. While the June is 64 degrees.
- At 75% of the time, the temperature is 77 dregees or higher in June and 74 dregees highter in Decemember.

Those two addition quaries can solid statistical analysis because it provide us a summary of different statistics for the amount of precipitation between June and December.Such as the relationship between temperature and precipitation.
